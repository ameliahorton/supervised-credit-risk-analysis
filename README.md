# supervised-credit-risk-analysis
This assignment involves creating two different supervised learning models for the same dataset: a logistic regression model and a random forest classifier model. Prior to completing the assignment I wasn't sure which model would be better for this data, but my guess was that the logistic regression would be better because of the number of different datatypes represented in the dataframe. After I did the assignment I found that the logistic regression and the randon forest had very similar testing scores, but the logistic regression was very slightly better.
